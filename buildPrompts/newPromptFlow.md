# Step 1:
In the src/components directory, create a Header.js file and a LandingPage.js file. The header should have three buttons in the right-hand corner: About, Settings and Login. And there should be a cool logo in the left corner.

The landingPage should display in two columns images from unsplash in a fixed square size - 5 images.

# Step 2:
Add the header and the LandingPage to the page.js. Remove everything else from the page.js

# Step 3:

The images should be fetched from the unsplash API and the logos should be svg illustrations. It shouldn't be the unsplash API that requires any API, just the link to publicly available unsplash images.

# Step 4:
All styling should be TailwindCSS, no css files
